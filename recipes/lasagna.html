    <!-- list of steps -->
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet, cook 2 pounds of ground beef over medium-high heat until it's browned and no longer pink. Break it into small pieces as it cooks.</li>
        <li>Dice the white onion and mince the garlic cloves.
            Add the diced onion and minced garlic to the browned beef and sauté for a few minutes until the onions become translucent.
            Pour in the can of crushed tomatoes and add 2 tablespoons of sugar to the mixture. Stir well.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low and let the sauce simmer for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally. This allows the flavors to meld together and the sauce to thicken slightly.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to the temperature indicated on the lasagna noodle package (usually around 350°F or 175°C).
            In a greased baking dish, start layering the lasagna. Begin with a layer of the meat sauce, followed by a layer of lasagna noodles, a layer of sliced mozzarella cheese, and repeat until you've used up all your ingredients, finishing with a layer of sauce on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes, or until the lasagna is hot and bubbly.
            Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes until the top is golden and the cheese is melted and slightly browned.
            Let the lasagna rest for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy!</li>
